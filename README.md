# Form Buster: Online Form Approval and Tracking

Form Buster is a senior design project that aims to fully digitalize the university forms submission and approval process. It offers novel features such as forms tracking and automatic routing of forms based on approvers. Users can access a friendly interface where they perform actions such as submitting forms, approve or decline forms, receive forms-related notifications, and student form records look-up among others. The system is designed to be easily interoperable with existing authentication systems and databases.
